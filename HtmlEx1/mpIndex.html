            <strong>Mobile Panini</strong> is the culmination of the dream of Antonio and Carmen
            Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people the
            authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he
            learned the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his
            technique at the Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother,
            Carmen, with no less of a love for cooking and good food, also
            worked in the deli and became well-acquainted with the open-air
            fresh food markets of his home town. Carmen too, is a proud graduate of the
            Culinary Institute of Milan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside
            your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of
            preparation. We've partnered with <em>Curbside Thai</em> to bring you the
            finest cuisine on four wheels - from the East and the West!
