         <h1>About the GCC</h1>
         <p>
            Founded in 1965, the Gresham Children's Choir seeks to enhance 
            the musical development of children by instilling in them a love of
            ensemble singing. By striving for artistic excellence 
            and learning a diverse repertory of choral literature, our children
            build self-confidence and learn the joys of working together
            to create beautiful music for an appreciative audience.

            <p>
               Born and raised in eastern Ohio, David Chen studied conducting, 
               voice, and piano at the University of Southern California's Thornton 
               School of Music. David returned to Gresham two years ago to take
               over direction of the GCC. The children appreciate David's demand
               for quality performances while still maintaining a fun and playful
               atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p>As a performer, he has sung in Los Angeles with the USC Thornton 
               Choral Artists under the direction of Helen Von Allen. He has
               also been working on a project to edit and perform the 
               sacred works of Hildegard of Bingen. Look for the premier
               of his efforts next summer.
